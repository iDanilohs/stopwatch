## Documentation

We need to export the module time with the attribute sleep, because it is very important for the stopwatch takes the correct time in seconds.

The show function is to avoid repeating unnecessary lines of code. This function has 3 parameters: hours, minutes and seconds and shows in the console the string with these parameters.

The run function is the main function and has all the logic of the chronometer. First the status variable is to ask the user for the number one to start the count and also instructs on how to stop the stopwatch.   

The variables seconds, minutes and hours have the purpose of counting each measurement.

Finally the while loop is the heart of the logic of this project, because with it the program knows when and what to do in certain situations and of course the limits.
